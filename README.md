# Batch Connect - VT-ARC autoHPC

This app is a convinience form that creates the project file needed for autoHPC.

## Prerequisites

NONE

## Install

Use git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:

```sh
git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
git fetch
git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.
